# Implementation Plan

Personal project implementing a cross-chain rebase token protocol with Chainlink CCIP.

Started: October 2025
Target completion: 10-12 days

Note: This is my first structured GitHub project. Previously I learned and coded without proper version control or documentation. Using this project to build professional development habits.

## Daily Workflow

Standard development session (3-4 hours):
1. Review roadmap and previous day's work (15 min)
2. Code/test current milestone (2-3 hours)
3. Write commit message and push (15 min)
4. Update roadmap progress (10 min)

Commit message format:
```
<type>: <description>

<optional body>
```

Types: feat, fix, test, docs, refactor, chore

---

## Testing Strategy

Target: >95% coverage

Structure:
```
test/
├── unit/           Individual function tests
├── integration/    Contract interaction tests  
└── fork/           Cross-chain tests
```

Run before each commit:
- forge test
- forge fmt
- Check no compiler warnings

---

## Technical Decisions Log

Track major decisions and rationale:

**Decision 1: Linear interest calculation**
- Rationale: Gas efficiency (~30k vs ~200k for compound)
- Trade-off: Less accurate for long-term holders
- Status: Implemented

**Decision 2: Per-user interest rates**
- Rationale: Fair incentive for early adopters
- Trade-off: More complex state management
- Status: Implemented

**Decision 3: Custom CCIP pool**
- Rationale: Need to encode user rates in bridge messages
- Trade-off: More code to write and audit
- Status: Implemented

Add more as development progresses.

## Blockers & Solutions



Common issues:
- Compilation errors: Check import paths
- Test failures: Add console.log for debugging
- Fork test issues: Verify RPC endpoints working

---

## Notes

This is a learning project demonstrating understanding of:
- Cross-chain protocols (Chainlink CCIP)
- DeFi mechanics (rebase tokens, interest accrual)
- Smart contract security patterns
- Professional development workflow

Based on concepts from Cyfrin Updraft Advanced Foundry course, Section 4.
All code rewritten with my own improvements and documentation.

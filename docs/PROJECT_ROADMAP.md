# Implementation Plan

Personal project implementing a cross-chain rebase token protocol with Chainlink CCIP.

Started: October 2025
Current: Day 3 complete

Note: This is my first structured GitHub project. Previously I learned and coded without proper version control or documentation. Using this project to build professional development habits.

## Completed Work Detail

### Day 1-2: Token & Vault (✅ Complete)

**RebaseToken.sol** - Core rebase mechanics
- Per-user interest rates (not global rebase)
- Linear interest calculation (gas-efficient)
- Lazy minting pattern (interest calculated on-demand)
- **Security fix:** Rate downgrade protection
- Access control via OpenZeppelin roles

**Vault.sol** - Entry point for deposits/redemptions
- Deposit ETH → receive RebaseTokens
- Redeem RebaseTokens → receive ETH
- CEI pattern for reentrancy protection
- Only deployed on L1 (Sepolia)

**Testing:**
- 50 unit tests covering all functions
- Fuzz tests for edge cases
- Security tests (reentrancy, rate manipulation)
- >95% code coverage

### Day 3: CCIP Integration (✅ Complete)

**RebaseTokenPool.sol** - Custom CCIP pool
- Burn & Mint pattern for cross-chain transfers
- Encodes user interest rate in CCIP message
- Preserves rate across chains via `destPoolData`
- Compatible with CCIP v1.5

**Key Implementation Details:**
- `lockOrBurn`: Captures rate before burning from pool balance
- `releaseOrMint`: Decodes rate and mints with preserved rate
- Handles rate upgrades automatically (never downgrades)

**Git Commits:**
- `feat: implement RebaseToken with security improvements`
- `test: add comprehensive RebaseToken unit tests`
- `feat: add Vault contract with CEI pattern`
- `test: add Vault tests including reentrancy protection`
- `feat: implement RebaseTokenPool compatible with CCIP v1.5`

## Test Strategy

**Current Coverage: ~95%** (50+ tests)

Structure:
```
test/
├── unit/           Individual contract tests
│   ├── RebaseToken.t.sol (24 tests) ✅
│   ├── Vault.t.sol (26 tests) ✅
│   └── RebaseTokenPool.t.sol (next)
└── integration/    Cross-chain flow tests
    └── CrossChain.t.sol (planned)
```

Run before each commit:
- `forge test`
- `forge fmt`
- Check no compiler warnings

## Technical Decisions Log

**Decision 1: Linear interest calculation**
- Rationale: Gas efficiency (~30k vs ~200k for compound)
- Trade-off: Less accurate for long-term holders
- Status: ✅ Implemented

**Decision 2: Per-user interest rates**
- Rationale: Fair incentive for early adopters
- Trade-off: More complex state management
- Status: ✅ Implemented

**Decision 3: Rate downgrade protection**
- Rationale: Prevent griefing attacks
- Trade-off: Slightly more complex mint logic
- Status: ✅ Implemented (security improvement)

**Decision 4: CEI pattern in Vault**
- Rationale: Reentrancy protection
- Trade-off: None (best practice)
- Status: ✅ Implemented

**Decision 5: Custom CCIP pool**
- Rationale: Need to encode user rates in bridge messages
- Trade-off: More code to write and test
- Status: ✅ Implemented

**Decision 6: CCIP v1.5 compatibility**
- Rationale: Latest stable version
- Trade-off: Different from course materials (v1.2)
- Status: ✅ Implemented (4-arg constructor)

---

## Blockers & Solutions

**Blocker 1: CCIP version mismatch**
- Issue: Course used v1.2, installed v1.5
- Solution: Updated TokenPool constructor (removed decimals param)
- Status: ✅ Resolved

**Blocker 2: Receiver type confusion**
- Issue: Unclear if `receiver` was bytes or address
- Solution: CCIP v1.5 uses address directly
- Status: ✅ Resolved

## Notes

This is a learning project demonstrating understanding of:
- Cross-chain protocols (Chainlink CCIP)
- DeFi mechanics (rebase tokens, interest accrual)
- Smart contract security patterns
- Professional development workflow

Based on concepts from Cyfrin Updraft Advanced Foundry course (Section 4), but implemented independently with my own improvements and security fixes.
